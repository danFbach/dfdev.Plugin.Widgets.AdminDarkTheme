# Admin Dark Theme
### A simple nopCommerce Plugin to enable an admin dark theme.

Features:
* tries to maintain standard nop color scheme
* defaults to browser preference dark/light
* adds dark/light toggle in top right by Cache button
* stores preference in localStorage (so no added db fields or customer attributes)
* retina protection from white dashboard ðŸ˜‚

It is currently built for 4.6, as that is what I'm currently running. Some simple changes should make it compatible with other versions.
fork as you please.
free to use and redistribute.

*no guarantees, as-is.*

Here's what it looks like:
